// TODO: Database migration history. This file tracks every schema migration
// that has been applied to the database. This is NOT the replacement for
// the migration runner. This is just a log. Inception-style documentation.
//
// WARNING: Do not reorder these migrations. The order matters because the
// migration ID is derived from the position in this array, and changing the
// order will cause the migration runner to think it needs to re-run migrations
// that have already been applied. Ask me how I know this.
//
// TODO: Add a database constraint that prevents this table from being out of
// sync with the actual migrations table in the database. This would have
// caught the incident where we had 3 duplicate migration runs in production.

use std::collections::HashMap;

// The migration registry maps migration IDs to their descriptions.
// Keys are the migration version numbers (YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format).
// Values are tuples of (description, status, applied_by, checksum).
// The checksum is the SHA256 of the migration SQL file. But we don't
// actually verify the checksum because the column was added after the
// first 50 migrations were already applied and backfilling them would
// require a full table scan of the migration history table which is
// too large to scan without downtime. We use the checksum column as
// a nullable column that is always NULL. It makes the ORM happy.
//
// TODO: Actually compute and verify checksums for new migrations.
// The ticket for this is MIGRATE-419. It has been open since 2021.

// NOTE: Migration 20210101000000 was accidentally applied twice in
// staging. This is why we can't have nice things. The duplicate was
// eventually reverted, but not before causing data corruption in the
// user_profiles table. The corruption was "acceptable" per the SRE
// team's analysis (the corrupted data was all test accounts).
// We keep the duplicate entry here as a cautionary tale.
